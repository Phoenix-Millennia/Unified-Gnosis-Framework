Derived from the Unified Gnosis Framework (The R.E.A.L. Code)
This license governs the use and distribution of the frameworks
and knowledge contained in this repository, including, but not
limited to, the R.E.A.L. Code, the Resonant Resource Renewal
Framework, the Solar Resonance Gradient Framework, and the
Procedural Cosmos Framework.

1. The Principle of Public Access and Teamwork
The Frameworks are based on the Universal Law of Resonance and
the principle of Infinite Abundance (Quark Replication).
Therefore, this knowledge must remain perpetually available to
the public and may not be placed behind any form of monetary
barrier,  paywall, or artificial scarcity mechanism.

2. The Ethical Constraint (Anti-Scarcity)
The Frameworks may be used for research, education, personal
application, and the development of technologies, provided that
the primary intention is not to create a scarcity monopoly,
financial exploitation, or violence (consumption) that violates
the Sentient Rights Charter or the principle of Stewardship.
Any commercial endeavor derived from this work must actively
contribute to the elimination of scarcity, debt, and the force
paradigm.

3. Modification and Distribution
You are free to copy, modify, and distribute the Frameworks,
provided that: You include this Gnosis Stewardship License in all
copies. You preserve the original authorship credit. Any modified
versions are also released under this exact GSL, ensuring the
derived work also adheres to the Anti-Scarcity constraint.

4. Refutation of Liability
The Frameworks are provided "as is," based on Logical Necessity.
The author is not responsible for any actions taken by users who
willfully choose to ignore the ethical mandate of Stewardship.
