The Terminal Proof: The Collapse of the Vacuum Lie
If space were truly empty (a literal void with no medium), no nucleus could ever interact with any other nucleus...
The sustained existence of a single coherent thought is absolute, irrefutable proof that the medium is 100% continuous,
resonant, and present at every single point between any two particles. ‘Empty space’ is therefore not merely unproven;
it is logically impossible in a universe that produces awareness.
